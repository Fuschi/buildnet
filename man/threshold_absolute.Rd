\title{Threshold correlation matrix by absolute value}
\usage{
threshold_absolute(cor_mat, min_cor = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{cor_mat}{Correlation matrix (numeric, symmetric).}

\item{min_cor}{Minimum absolute correlation to include as an edge. In \verb{[0, 1]}.}
}
\value{
Numeric symmetric adjacency matrix. Weights retain the (signed) correlation
wherever \code{|r| >= min_cor}; zeros elsewhere. Diagonal is set to 0.
}
\description{
Build an adjacency matrix by applying a minimum absolute-correlation cutoff.
