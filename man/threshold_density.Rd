\title{Threshold correlation matrix to achieve target edge density}
\usage{
threshold_density(cor_mat, density = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{cor_mat}{Correlation matrix (numeric, symmetric).}

\item{density}{Target density in (0, 1]. For p nodes, target edges ~ \code{density * p*(p-1)/2}.}
}
\value{
Numeric symmetric adjacency matrix with retained correlations as weights.
}
\description{
Keep the largest absolute correlations until the desired undirected edge density.
